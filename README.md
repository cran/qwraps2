A collection of helpful functions for summarizing data and formating results.
These functions are almost certainly found in other R packages on github.com, or
on CRAN.  This is a collection of methods I have generated to help with
particular projects I have worked on over the last several years.  Using my
origiinal `qwraps` package as the foundation, this work is aimed at simplicity
and ease of use.

## Contribute!

## Install

### From CRAN
Download and install from
[The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

    install.packages("qwraps2", repo = "http://cran.rstudio.com")

### Developmental
Install the development version of `qwraps2` directly from github via the 
[`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/) package:

    if (!("devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { 
      warning("installing devtools from https://cran.rstudio.com")
      install.packages("devtools", 
                       repo = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
    }

    devtools::install_github("dewittpe/qwraps2", 
                             build_vignettes = TRUE)

*NOTE:* If you are working on a Windows machine you will need to download and
install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) before
`devtools` will work for you.

### Cloned repo
Install with GNU `make`

    make install
